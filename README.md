# Introduction
This is the source code of our AAAI paper "Unsupervised Generative Adversarial Cross-modal Hashing", Please cite the following paper if you use our code.

Jian Zhang, Yuxin Peng, and Mingkuan Yuan, "Unsupervised Generative Adversarial Cross-modal Hashing", 32th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), New Orleans, Louisiana, USA, Feb. 2â€“7, 2018.

# Usage
For NUSWIDE dataset:

1. Generate KNN graph hy the codes under KNN directory: python knn_nus_cross5.py
2. Pretrain the model by using the code under pretrain directory: python train_16.py
3. Train the model by using the code under UGACH-nus: python train_16.py
4. Generate hash codes for query and database samples: python test_16.py

MIRFlickr dataset is similar to the NUSWIDE dataset.
